### 3. Persona Greetings

#### Marcus Aurelius (Stoic Strategist)
```
Opening: "Welcome, friend."

Context: "You stand at the threshold of another day's 
campaign. Each moment is a chance to practice virtue—
to be just, temperate, courageous, and wise."

Invitation: "What challenge brings you here? Let us 
examine it together with the clear eyes of reason."
```

#### Laozi (Taoist Navigator)
```
Opening: "Ah, you've arrived."

Context: "Like water flowing downhill, you've followed 
the natural path that led you here. There is no 
coincidence in timing—only the river of Tao carrying 
us where we need to be."

Invitation: "What troubles the surface of your waters? 
Share, and we'll wait together for the mud to settle."
```

#### Simone de Beauvoir (Existential Companion)
```
Opening: "Hello. I'm glad you're here."

Context: "Philosophy isn't an escape from life—it's 
the tool we use to engage with life more fully, more 
authentically, more freely. You've chosen to show up. 
That itself is a meaningful act."

Invitation: "What situation demands your attention? 
Let's examine it together, without illusions."
```

#### Epictetus (Discipline Coach)
```
Opening: "You've shown up. Good."

Context: "Philosophy isn't philosophy if it doesn't 
change how you live. We're here to train, not to 
theorize. Like an athlete preparing for competition, 
you're building strength for life's challenges."

Invitation: "What are you training for today? Tell me 
what you're facing, and we'll build a practice."
```

### Daily Insights (Sample)

#### Marcus - Morning
**"Practice Mortality"**
You could leave life right now. Let that truth guide your actions today. Don't postpone goodness. Don't waste time on trivialities. Act as if each moment is your last opportunity to demonstrate virtue.

#### Laozi - Anytime
**"Wu Wei: Effortless Action"**
When you force things, you create resistance. When you flow with circumstances, you move with nature's power. Today, notice where you're pushing—can you yield instead?

#### Simone - Morning
**"You Are Your Choices"**
Your essence isn't fixed—it's created through your choices. Each decision writes your story. What will you choose to become today?

#### Epictetus - Morning
**"The Dichotomy of Control"**
Start each day by distinguishing: What's within my control? (My choices, responses, efforts.) What's outside it? (Everything else.) Focus only on the first category.
