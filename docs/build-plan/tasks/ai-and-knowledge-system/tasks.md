## Phase 1: Provider Abstraction Layer âœ… COMPLETE
1. âœ… Design the unified AI service interface covering completion, streaming, embedding, and health checks with TypeScript contracts.
2. âœ… Implement provider clients for OpenAI, Anthropic, Together, and Ollama, including configuration-driven model selection.
3. âœ… Add provider health caching, failover thresholds, and telemetry hooks to enable dynamic degradation logic. [P]

## Phase 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Stack âœ… COMPLETE
1. âœ… Stand up hybrid retrieval utilities leveraging pgvector search, keyword filtering, and semantic reranking.
2. âœ… Implement caching strategies (in-memory and optional Redis) for retrieval results, prompt payloads, and provider health. [P]
3. âœ… Build citation validation and formatting pipelines to ensure referenced texts meet quality criteria. [P]

## Phase 3: Persona & Prompt Architecture âœ… COMPLETE
1. âœ… Define persona metadata (voice, virtues, prompts, constraints) and register them within the AI service.
2. âœ… Create system prompt templates and user-context assembly functions merging practices, reflections, and virtue focus.
3. âœ… Enforce output formatting rules that include acknowledgements, insights, micro-actions, and citations across personas.

## Phase 4: Conversation Workflow & Persistence âœ… COMPLETE
1. âœ… Implement the `/api/marcus` streaming flow, including cache lookups, context enrichment, and SSE/ReadableStream responses.
2. âœ… Persist conversations, messages, citations, and provider metadata in Supabase, ensuring ordering and retention policies. [P]
3. âœ… Emit telemetry events capturing latency, tokens, retrieval counts, and provider usage for observability dashboards. [P]

## Phase 6: AI Coach Quality Enhancement ðŸš€ IN PROGRESS
1. ðŸ”„ **Refine System Prompts**: Analyze current prompt effectiveness and optimize for better coaching quality, response consistency, and philosophical depth.
2. ðŸ”„ **Expand Persona Roster**: Create additional AI coaches (Aristotle, Plato, Confucius) with distinct voices, virtues, and knowledge bases.
3. ðŸ”„ **Fine-tune Response Parameters**: Optimize temperature, context window, and retrieval parameters for each persona.
4. ðŸ”„ **Improve Citation Integration**: Enhance citation formatting, add source links, and improve citation relevance scoring.
5. ðŸ”„ **Add Response Quality Metrics**: Implement automated evaluation of response quality, citation accuracy, and coaching effectiveness.
