# Project Foundations & Environment - Task Plan

## Phase 1: Specification Alignment
1. [Complete] Inventory all build specifications (system overview, frontend, backend & data, AI) and extract feature, constraint, and success-criteria highlights into a shared outline.
2. [Complete] Facilitate a cross-discipline review to confirm scope boundaries, identify open questions, and record dependencies or blockers.
3. [Complete] Publish the master scope document in the project knowledge base and circulate sign-off requests from engineering, product, and design leads.

## Phase 2: Environment Bootstrap
1. [Complete] Initialize the Next.js 14 + TypeScript repository with the documented directory layout and base configuration files.
2. [Complete] Install Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Zustand, TanStack Query, and supporting lint/test tooling; capture the package manifest and configuration notes in the repo README.
3. [Complete] Configure shared linting and formatting rules (ESLint, Prettier) alongside Jest and Playwright baselines. [P]
4. [Complete] Scaffold the environment variable validation module (lib/env-validation.ts) and supply an example .env.local template populated with placeholders for Supabase, AI providers, analytics, and email credentials. [P]

## Phase 3: Repository Structure Hardening
1. [Complete] Recreate required top-level directories (pp/, lib/, database/, public/, scripts/) and seed each with placeholder docs describing intended responsibilities.
2. [Started] Verify references between specs and repository paths, updating documentation if discrepancies appear.
3. [Complete] Run a workspace health check (lint, type check, unit smoke test) to ensure the baseline environment is reproducible for all contributors.
