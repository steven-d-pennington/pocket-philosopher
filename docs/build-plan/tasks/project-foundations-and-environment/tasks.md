# Project Foundations & Environment â€” Task Plan

## Phase 1: Specification Alignment
1. Inventory all build specifications (system overview, frontend, backend & data, AI) and extract feature, constraint, and success-criteria highlights into a shared outline.
2. Facilitate a cross-discipline review to confirm scope boundaries, identify open questions, and record dependencies or blockers.
3. Publish the master scope document in the project knowledge base and circulate sign-off requests from engineering, product, and design leads.

## Phase 2: Environment Bootstrap
1. Initialize the Next.js 14 + TypeScript repository with the documented directory layout and base configuration files.
2. Install Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Zustand, TanStack Query, and supporting lint/test tooling; capture the package manifest and configuration notes in the repo README.
3. Configure shared linting and formatting rules (ESLint, Prettier) alongside Jest and Playwright baselines. [P]
4. Scaffold the environment variable validation module (`lib/env-validation.ts`) and supply an example `.env.local` template populated with placeholders for Supabase, AI providers, analytics, and email credentials. [P]

## Phase 3: Repository Structure Hardening
1. Recreate required top-level directories (`app/`, `lib/`, `database/`, `public/`, `scripts/`) and seed each with placeholder docs describing intended responsibilities.
2. Verify references between specs and repository paths, updating documentation if discrepancies appear.
3. Run a workspace health check (lint, type check, unit smoke test) to ensure the baseline environment is reproducible for all contributors.
