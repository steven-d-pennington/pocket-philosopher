# Testing & Quality Assurance â€” Task Plan

## Phase 1: Automated Testing Foundations
1. Configure Jest for unit and integration coverage across stores, hooks, API routes, and AI modules, including module mocks and shared fixtures.
2. Stand up Playwright end-to-end suites covering auth, onboarding, habit logging, reflections, coach chat, and offline scenarios; define test data management strategy.
3. Establish reusable testing utilities (factories, Supabase seeders, mock AI providers) to streamline scenario creation. [P]

## Phase 2: AI Evaluation Harness
1. Build regression harness validating persona adherence, citation accuracy, and output formatting for AI responses.
2. Integrate evaluation runs into CI with thresholds that gate merges; document remediation procedures for failures. [P]
3. Monitor evaluation metrics over time and maintain a backlog of prompt or retrieval adjustments informed by results. [P]

## Phase 3: CI/CD Integration
1. Configure CI pipelines to run linting, type checks, unit tests, Playwright suites, and AI evaluations on pull requests and main branch builds.
2. Prepare deployment automation scripts for Vercel/Fly.io with environment promotion checks and rollback hooks. [P]
3. Establish notification channels (Slack/email) for build failures, flaky test reports, and evaluation regressions; document escalation flows. [P]
