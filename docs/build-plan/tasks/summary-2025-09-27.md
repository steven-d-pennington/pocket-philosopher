# Build-Plan Task Update - 2025-09-27

## Highlights
- Completed the spec-to-repo audit (`docs/build-plan/tasks/project-foundations-and-environment/spec-to-path-audit.md`) so all documented paths now have confirmed references.
- Finalized Supabase seed automation and expanded `supabase/README.md` with authentication, RLS verification, and backup/monitoring guidance, closing the remaining Phase 1 backend gaps.
- Introduced `lib/analytics/server.ts` and instrumented practice API flows to capture create/update/delete/complete events in PostHog.

## Task Status Changes
- project-foundations-and-environment/tasks.md: Phase 3 Step 2 marked **Complete** after publishing the audit.
- data-and-backend-infrastructure/tasks.md: Phase 1 Steps 1-3 now **Complete**; Phase 2 Step 3 and Phase 3 Step 1 remain **Complete** with new seed script and middleware docs; index/policy backlog still **Started**.
- analytics-observability-and-security/tasks.md: Phase 1 Step 1 note updated to reflect backend event tracking progress.

## Next Focus
- Build out structured logging and `/api/health` diagnostics to finish Analytics Phase 1 Step 3.
- Capture AI usage metrics (latency, token counts, retrieval stats) and pipe them into PostHog or the future observability sink.
- Begin designing the AI provider abstraction once logging/metrics plumbing proves stable.
