# Pocket Philosopher Build Tasks Execution Guide

This guide outlines a recommended execution sequence for the task plans derived from the build-plan specifications. Follow each step in order; tasks labeled with **[P]** in the component plans can be run in parallel once their prerequisites are met. Each section now includes a status snapshot based on current progress.

## Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Project Foundations & Environment**  
   - **Status:** Complete (Phases 1-3 in project-foundations-and-environment/tasks.md delivered; spec-to-path audits remain marked as Started).  
   - Follow the tasks to confirm scope, bootstrap the repository, and finalize baseline tooling. Completion of Phase 2 unlocks parallelizable environment hardening tasks for other teams.
2. **Data & Backend Infrastructure (Phase 1 prerequisites only)**  
   - **Status:** Started (local Supabase configured, schema and RLS applied; staging/production provisioning still pending).  
   - Execute Supabase provisioning tasks to ensure database availability for downstream work and coordinate on environment variables and access controls.
3. **Frontend Architecture & User Experience (Phase 1 & 2)**  
   - **Status:** In Progress (App Router layouts, auth guard, navigation, and dashboard stubs delivered; analytics hooks + metadata scaffolding now live, offline persistence utilities still pending).  
   - Implement the application shell, routing, and state infrastructure per the task plan before beginning [P] analytics/local storage utilities.
4. **AI & Knowledge System (Phase 1 & 2)**  
   - **Status:** Not Started.  
   - Stand up the provider abstraction and retrieval stack once Supabase schemas and environment variables are ready.
5. **Data & Backend Infrastructure (Phases 2-4)**  
   - **Status:** In Progress (automations implemented; core API routes for auth/profile/daily progress/practices/progress/reflections/health/debug complete; AI endpoints stubbed awaiting orchestration; logging/metrics tasks pending).  
   - Implement database automations, middleware, and API routes, coordinating with AI and frontend teams to validate contracts and streaming behaviors.
6. **Frontend Architecture & User Experience (Phases 3-4)**  
   - **Status:** Started (core routes scaffolded with placeholder components; practices CRUD modals, streaming UI, and PWA work outstanding).  
   - Build core dashboard flows, component libraries, and PWA enhancements as backend and AI endpoints stabilize.
7. **AI & Knowledge System (Phases 3-5)**  
   - **Status:** Not Started.  
   - Finalize persona prompts, conversation workflows, corpus ingestion, and telemetry once foundational services are ready.
8. **Analytics, Observability & Security**  
   - **Status:** Not Started.  
   - Apply controls from the task plan, leveraging instrumentation hooks established earlier; run [P] accessibility and security tasks once primary flows exist in staging.
9. **Deployment & Operations**  
   - **Status:** Not Started.  
   - Prepare Docker tooling, rollout guides, runbooks, and post-launch governance.
10. **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
    - **Status:** Not Started.  
    - Implement automated testing, AI evaluation harness, and CI/CD workflows as described in the task plan and integrate with deployment processes.
11. **Final Verification**  
    - **Status:** Not Started.  
    - Ensure all component tasks (including parallel [P] items) are complete, documentation is updated, and staging/production environments are in sync before declaring the rebuild feature-complete.

## Parallelization Tips
- Treat **[P]** tasks as candidates for separate work streams once the preceding numbered items in their phase are finished.
- Use weekly syncs between frontend, backend, and AI leads to coordinate shared dependencies and adjust sequencing as needed.
- Maintain a shared Kanban board mirroring these steps to track ownership and progress.
