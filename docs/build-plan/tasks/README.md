# Pocket Philosopher Build Tasks Execution Guide

This guide outlines a recommended execution sequence for the task plans derived from the build-plan specifications. Follow each step in order; tasks labeled with **[P]** in the component plans can be run in parallel once their prerequisites are met.

## Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Project Foundations & Environment**  
   - Follow the tasks in `project-foundations-and-environment/tasks.md` to confirm scope, bootstrap the repository, and finalize baseline tooling.  
   - Completion of Phase 2 unlocks parallelizable environment hardening tasks for other teams.
2. **Data & Backend Infrastructure (Phase 1 prerequisites only)**  
   - Execute Supabase provisioning tasks in `data-and-backend-infrastructure/tasks.md` to ensure database availability for downstream work.  
   - Coordinate with the foundations team for environment variables and access controls.
3. **Frontend Architecture & User Experience (Phase 1 & 2)**  
   - Implement the application shell, routing, and state infrastructure per `frontend-architecture-and-user-experience/tasks.md`.  
   - Begin [P] tasks (analytics hooks, local storage utilities) once foundational routing is stable.
4. **AI & Knowledge System (Phase 1 & 2)**  
   - Stand up the provider abstraction and retrieval stack using `ai-and-knowledge-system/tasks.md`.  
   - These efforts can run alongside frontend state work after Supabase schemas and environment variables are ready.
5. **Data & Backend Infrastructure (Phases 2–4)**  
   - Implement database automations, middleware, and API routes.  
   - Coordinate with AI and frontend teams to validate contracts and streaming behaviors.
6. **Frontend Architecture & User Experience (Phases 3–4)**  
   - Build core dashboard flows, component libraries, and PWA enhancements, leveraging backend and AI endpoints as they stabilize.
7. **AI & Knowledge System (Phases 3–5)**  
   - Finalize persona prompts, conversation workflows, corpus ingestion, and telemetry integration.
8. **Analytics, Observability & Security**  
   - Apply the controls outlined in `analytics-observability-and-security/tasks.md`, leveraging instrumentation hooks established earlier.  
   - Run [P] accessibility and security tasks once primary flows exist in staging.
9. **Deployment & Operations**  
   - Use `deployment-and-operations/tasks.md` to prepare Docker tooling, rollout guides, runbooks, and post-launch governance.
10. **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
    - Implement the automated testing, AI evaluation harness, and CI/CD workflows described in `testing-and-quality-assurance/tasks.md`.  
    - Integrate with deployment processes to gate releases.
11. **Final Verification**  
    - Ensure all component tasks (including parallel [P] items) are complete, documentation is updated, and staging/production environments are in sync before declaring the rebuild feature-complete.

## Parallelization Tips
- Treat **[P]** tasks as candidates for separate work streams once the preceding numbered items in their phase are finished.
- Use weekly syncs between frontend, backend, and AI leads to coordinate shared dependencies and adjust sequencing as needed.
- Maintain a shared Kanban board mirroring these steps to track ownership and progress.
