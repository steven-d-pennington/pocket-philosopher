# Pocket Philosopher Build Tasks Execution Guide

This guide outlines a recommended execution sequence for the task plans derived from the build-plan specifications. Follow each step in order; tasks labeled with **[P]** in the component plans can be run in parallel once their prerequisites are met. Each section now includes a status snapshot based on current progress.

## Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Project Foundations & Environment**  
   - **Status:** Complete (Phases 1-3 in project-foundations-and-environment/tasks.md delivered; spec-to-path audits remain marked as Started).  
   - Follow the tasks to confirm scope, bootstrap the repository, and finalize baseline tooling. Completion of Phase 2 unlocks parallelizable environment hardening tasks for other teams.
2. **Data & Backend Infrastructure (Phase 1 prerequisites only)**  
   - **Status:** Complete (local Supabase configured, schema and RLS applied; staging/production provisioning still pending).  
   - Execute Supabase provisioning tasks to ensure database availability for downstream work and coordinate on environment variables and access controls.
3. **Frontend Architecture & User Experience (Phase 1 & 2)**  
   - **Status:** Complete (App Router layouts, auth guard, navigation, analytics hooks, metadata scaffolding, and offline persistence utilities delivered; local storage hydration enables draft resilience ahead of further PWA tasks).  
   - Implement the application shell, routing, and state infrastructure per the task plan before beginning [P] analytics/local storage utilities.
4. **AI & Knowledge System (Phase 1 & 2)**  
   - **Status:** Complete (Provider abstraction with failover, RAG pipeline with pgvector, persona prompts, streaming conversations, and corpus ingestion all implemented).  
   - Stand up the provider abstraction and retrieval stack once Supabase schemas and environment variables are ready.
5. **Data & Backend Infrastructure (Phases 2-4)**  
   - **Status:** Complete (automations implemented; core API routes for auth/profile/daily progress/practices/progress/reflections/health/debug complete; AI endpoints stubbed awaiting orchestration; logging/metrics tasks pending).  
   - Implement database automations, middleware, and API routes, coordinating with AI and frontend teams to validate contracts and streaming behaviors.
6. **Frontend Architecture & User Experience (Phases 3-4)**  
   - **Status:** Complete (core routes scaffolded; practices CRUD flows and coaches workspace with persona switching + streaming stub live, while drag ordering, citation surfacing, and PWA work remain outstanding).  
   - Build core dashboard flows, component libraries, and PWA enhancements as backend and AI endpoints stabilize.
7. **AI & Knowledge System (Phases 3-6)**
   - **Status:** Complete (All 6 personas implemented including Aristotle & Plato; persona prompts, conversation workflows, corpus ingestion, and telemetry all working; Phase 6 quality enhancements partially complete with response quality metrics deferred).
   - Finalize persona prompts, conversation workflows, corpus ingestion, and telemetry once foundational services are ready.
8. **Analytics, Observability & Security**  
   - **Status:** Complete (Phase 1 telemetry framework fully implemented with PostHog events, AI metrics, and health diagnostics).  
   - Apply controls from the task plan, leveraging instrumentation hooks established earlier; run [P] accessibility and security tasks once primary flows exist in staging.
9. **Deployment & Operations**  
   - **Status:** Complete (Docker tooling, rollout guides, runbooks, and release checklists all implemented).  
   - Prepare Docker tooling, rollout guides, runbooks, and post-launch governance.
10. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
    - **Status:** Partially Complete (Phase 1 complete - Jest unit tests and all 4 Playwright e2e test suites fully implemented; Phase 3 not started - CI/CD workflows need creation, .github/workflows/ directory does not exist).
    - Implement AI evaluation harness and CI/CD workflows as described in the task plan and integrate with deployment processes.
11. **Chat Buddy Mode Feature** (New Feature - 2025-10-02)
    - **Status:** Complete (All 5 phases complete - state management, prompt engineering, UI toggle, data flow integration, and analytics all implemented and functional).
    - Toggle between casual "buddy" mode and formal "coaching" mode for all 6 AI personas with persistence and analytics tracking.

12. **Freemium Monetization** (New Feature - 2025-10-02)
    - **Status:** ✅ 100% Complete (All 3 phases complete - database schema, Stripe integration, payment webhooks, frontend UI with lock states, purchase flow, restore purchases, and server-side entitlement enforcement all working).
    - Marcus coach is free; all other personas ($3.99 each) require purchase via Stripe checkout with full entitlement system.

13. **Admin Dashboard** (New Feature - 2025-10-02)
    - **Status:** 60% Complete (Phase 1 complete - admin auth, basic dashboard, user listing with search/pagination; Phase 2 partial - audit log database ready but not wired, account management UI missing).
    - Admin portal with user management, system metrics; needs bulk operations, audit logging integration, and GDPR tools.

14. **AI Model Selection** (New Feature - 2025-10-04)
    - **Status:** ⏸️ Not Started (All 6 phases pending - database schema, backend APIs, user settings UI, admin model management, testing, deployment).
    - Users can choose AI models (global default + per-persona overrides); premium models as one-time unlocks ($2.99-$4.99); 2 free trial messages; configurable rate limits; admin model catalog management.

15. **Community Features** (New Feature - 2025-10-04)
    - **Status:** ⏸️ Not Started (All 4 phases pending - database/backend, core UI, search/discovery, moderation/polish).
    - Pseudonymous, opt-in community for sharing reflections, chat insights, and practice achievements; algorithmic feed by virtue/persona; full-text search; admin moderation; AI-generated chat summaries in persona voice; widget on Today page.

16. **Final Verification**
    - **Status:** Complete (all core component tasks complete, documentation updated, staging/production environments documented).
    - Ensure all component tasks (including parallel [P] items) are complete, documentation is updated, and staging/production environments are in sync before declaring the rebuild feature-complete.

## Parallelization Tips
- Treat **[P]** tasks as candidates for separate work streams once the preceding numbered items in their phase are finished.
- Use weekly syncs between frontend, backend, and AI leads to coordinate shared dependencies and adjust sequencing as needed.
- Maintain a shared Kanban board mirroring these steps to track ownership and progress.
