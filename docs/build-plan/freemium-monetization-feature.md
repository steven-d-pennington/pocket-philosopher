# Freemium Monetization Feature

## Overview
Pocket Philosopher will implement a freemium business model where core Stoicism content and the Marcus Aurelius coach are provided free, while additional philosophical coaches are available as $3.99 one-time expansion packs.

## Business Model
- **Free Tier**: Stoicism tradition and Marcus Aurelius coach (unlimited access)
- **Premium Expansion Packs**: Individual coaches at $3.99 each (Laozi, Simone de Beauvoir, Epictetus, future additions)
- **Payment Method**: One-time purchases via Stripe Checkout
- **Entitlements**: Permanent access once purchased

## User Experience
- **Onboarding**: Free access to Stoicism/Marcus immediately
- **Coach Selection**: Visual indicators for locked/unlocked coaches
- **Purchase Flow**: Seamless Stripe Checkout with success/cancel handling
- **Offline Access**: Cached content available, but premium features require network validation

## Technical Architecture
- **Database**: Products, purchases, and entitlements tables
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Checkout for one-time payments
- **Entitlement System**: Server-side enforcement for premium features
- **Analytics**: Purchase tracking and conversion metrics

## Implementation Phases
1. Database schema and product catalog setup
2. Stripe integration and webhook handling
3. Frontend UI updates and entitlement checks
4. Testing, analytics, and production deployment

## Success Metrics
- Conversion rate from free to paid users
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Purchase completion rate
- User retention and engagement with premium content

## Risk Mitigation
- **Payment Security**: Stripe's PCI compliance and webhook signature verification
- **Entitlement Integrity**: Server-side enforcement prevents client-side bypass
- **Refund Handling**: Automated revocation of entitlements for refunds
- **Fraud Prevention**: Rate limiting and suspicious activity monitoring

## Rollout Strategy
- **Staging**: Feature flag-controlled deployment for testing
- **Beta**: Limited user group with purchase analytics
- **Production**: Gradual rollout with monitoring and rollback capability
- **Support**: Documentation for purchase issues and entitlement restoration
