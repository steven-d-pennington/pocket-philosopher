# Project Foundations & Environment

## 1. Review Specifications & Define Scope
- Consolidate all requirements from the System Overview, Backend & Data, Frontend, and AI specifications.
- Produce a master scope document enumerating features, constraints, and success criteria.
- Identify cross-team dependencies and sequencing of subsystems.

## 2. Environment Setup
- Scaffold a Next.js 14 App Router project with TypeScript.
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Zustand, and TanStack Query.
- Establish shared linting, formatting, and testing baselines (ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Playwright).
- Implement environment variable validation (`lib/env-validation.ts`) and prepare a `.env.local` template including Supabase, AI provider, analytics, and email credentials.

## 3. Repository Structure
- Recreate the documented directory layout (e.g., `app/`, `lib/`, `database/`, `public/`, `scripts/`).
- Include placeholder files or README notes where needed to guide future implementation.
- Ensure structure aligns with spec references to ease collaboration across teams.
