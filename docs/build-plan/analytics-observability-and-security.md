# Analytics, Observability & Security

## 1. Telemetry Integration
- Instrument PostHog analytics across frontend and backend surfaces.
- Frontend PostHog provider now handles user identification from Supabase auth, captures page views, and records key UI events (practice toggles, intention saves); backend routing and schema docs still outstanding.
- Capture AI metrics, usage events, and performance indicators.
- Implement structured logging and health diagnostics endpoints.

## 2. Security & Privacy
- Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) and secure headers for all routes.
- Implement data sanitization, input validation, and RLS policy adherence.
- Redact sensitive AI prompts and ensure secrets are stored securely.

## 3. Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Audit keyboard navigation, semantic markup, and ARIA labels.
- Validate color contrast and ensure inclusive, shame-free messaging.
- Incorporate accessibility checks into development workflows.
