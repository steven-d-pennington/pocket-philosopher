# Persona-Specific Content System

## Overview

The Pocket Philosopher app now features a comprehensive persona-specific content system that adapts daily quotes, practice recommendations, reflection prompts, and AI coach communication styles based on the selected philosophical companion.

## Architecture

### Content Libraries

Three main content libraries provide persona-specific content:

1. **`lib/constants/persona-quotes.ts`** - Daily philosophical quotes
2. **`lib/constants/persona-practices.ts`** - Practice recommendations
3. **`lib/constants/persona-prompts.ts`** - Reflection prompts

### Date-Based Seeding

All content uses a consistent date-based seeding algorithm to ensure the same content appears for each persona on any given day:

```typescript
const seed = year * 1000 + month * 50 + date;
const index = seed % arrayLength;
```

This approach:
- Ensures daily consistency (same quote/practice all day)
- Changes content each day automatically
- Is deterministic and predictable
- Doesn't require database storage

## Content by Persona

## Implementation Details

### Components Using Persona Content

1. **DailyQuote** (`components/dashboard/daily-quote.tsx`)
   - Displays persona-specific daily quote
   - Uses `getDailyQuote(personaId)` from persona-quotes

2. **PersonaSuggestedPractice** (`components/dashboard/persona-suggested-practice.tsx`)
   - Shows daily practice recommendation
   - Uses `getSuggestedPractice(personaId)` from persona-practices
   - Includes rationale, difficulty badge, and quick-add button

3. **ReflectionComposer** (`components/reflections/reflection-composer.tsx`)
   - Shows time-appropriate reflection prompts in sidebar
   - Uses `getSuggestedPrompt(personaId, timeType)` from persona-prompts
   - Adapts prompts to morning/midday/evening

4. **AI Coach System** (`lib/ai/prompts/coach.ts`)
   - Injects persona-specific communication style
   - Uses `getPersonaStyleGuidance(personaId)` for distinct voices
   - Adapts response structure and language patterns

### State Management

The active persona is persisted in localStorage using Zustand's persist middleware:

```typescript
// lib/stores/coach-store.ts
persist(
  immer((set) => ({ /* store implementation */ })),
  {
    name: "coach-store",
    partialize: (state) => ({
      activePersonaId: state.activePersonaId,
    }),
  }
)
```

This ensures the selected persona persists across page refreshes.

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Persona-Specific Quotes

Each quote should:
- Reflect the philosopher's core philosophy
- Use language consistent with their communication style
- Include theme tags for future filtering
- Be 1-3 sentences (under 200 characters preferred)

### Creating Practice Recommendations

Each practice should include:
- **Name**: Clear, specific practice title
- **Description**: What the practice involves (2-3 sentences)
- **Virtue**: Which virtue this practice cultivates
- **Frequency**: Recommended schedule (daily, weekly, etc.)
- **Rationale**: Why this persona recommends it (philosophical grounding)
- **Difficulty**: beginner | intermediate | advanced

### Crafting Reflection Prompts

Each prompt should:
- Match the time of day (morning, midday, evening)
- Reflect the persona's philosophical approach
- Be open-ended but focused
- Include depth level (surface | moderate | deep)
- Optionally tie to a specific virtue

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Switch between all 4 personas and verify unique daily quotes appear
- [ ] Confirm practice recommendations change per persona
- [ ] Test reflection prompts adapt to morning/midday/evening
- [ ] Verify AI coach uses distinct communication style for each persona
- [ ] Check that persona selection persists after page refresh
- [ ] Ensure content changes daily (test on different dates or adjust seed)
- [ ] Confirm "Add this practice" button pre-fills modal correctly
- [ ] Test all components render correctly with persona theming

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Preferences**: Allow users to favorite certain quotes or practices
2. **Content Rotation**: Track which quotes/practices users have seen to ensure variety
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter practices by difficulty, virtue, or time commitment
4. **Custom Content**: Let premium users add their own persona-specific content
5. **Audio Quotes**: Record audio versions of daily quotes in appropriate voices
