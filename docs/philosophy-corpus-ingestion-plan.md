# Philosophy Corpus Ingestion Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the systematic ingestion of philosophical content to expand Pocket Philosopher's knowledge base. The current system supports 3 philosophers (Marcus Aurelius, Laozi, Jean-Paul Sartre) with limited content. We'll expand to 12+ philosophers across major philosophical traditions.

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing Corpus**: 3 philosophers (Marcus Aurelius, Laozi, Jean-Paul Sartre) with content, ~5-6 passages each, stored in `data/corpus/philosophy-corpus.json`
- **Personas Defined**: 4 AI personas (Marcus Aurelius, Laozi, Simone de Beauvoir, Epictetus) with distinct conversation styles
- **Gap**: Simone de Beauvoir and Epictetus have personas but no content in corpus yet
- **Ingestion Pipeline**: `scripts/ingest-corpus.ts` handles chunking, embedding generation, and database storage
- **Database Schema**: `philosophy_chunks` table with vector embeddings for RAG retrieval

## Target Philosophy Coverage

## Content Structure Requirements

### Per Philosopher Content Package
Each philosopher needs:
- **Core Texts**: 3-5 key passages (500-1000 words each)
- **Key Concepts**: 5-8 fundamental ideas with explanations
- **Practical Applications**: 3-5 actionable principles
- **Historical Context**: Brief biography and cultural background
- **Virtue Mappings**: Connection to cardinal virtues (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) or tradition-specific virtues

### Content Quality Standards
- **Authenticity**: Direct quotes or faithful paraphrases from primary sources
- **Accessibility**: Modern language while preserving philosophical depth
- **Actionability**: Each passage should suggest practical application
- **Diversity**: Include female philosophers, non-Western traditions, contemporary voices

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Enhancement (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Expand Corpus Schema
```json
{
  "works": [
    {
      "title": "Nicomachean Ethics",
      "author": "Aristotle",
      "tradition": "aristotelian",
      "era": "ancient",
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "The Golden Mean",
          "content": "...",
          "virtue": "temperance",
          "persona_tags": ["aristotle", "ethics", "golden_mean"],
          "key_concepts": ["eudaimonia", "virtue ethics", "practical wisdom"],
          "applications": ["decision making", "habit formation"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 1.2 Enhance Ingestion Script
- Add content validation
- Implement batch processing for large corpora
- Add duplicate detection
- Support for multiple embedding models
- Progress tracking and error recovery

#### 1.3 Database Optimizations
- Add indexes for tradition, virtue, persona_tags
- Implement content versioning
- Add metadata for content quality scores
- Support for content relationships (references between philosophers)

### Phase 2: Content Acquisition (Weeks 2-4)

#### 2.1 Primary Source Research
- **Method**: Systematic review of philosophical texts
- **Sources**: Project Gutenberg, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, primary texts
- **Criteria**: Select passages that are:
  - Representative of the philosopher's core ideas
  - Applicable to daily life and personal development
  - Suitable for conversational AI context

#### 2.2 Content Curation Process
1. **Text Selection**: Identify 3-5 key passages per philosopher
2. **Context Addition**: Add historical/cultural context
3. **Virtue Mapping**: Connect to relevant virtues and practices
4. **Persona Tagging**: Link to appropriate AI personas
5. **Quality Review**: Cross-reference with philosophical scholarship

#### 2.3 Content Expansion Strategy
- **Week 2**: Aristotle, Plato, Confucius, Buddha (4 philosophers)
- **Week 3**: Seneca, Chuang Tzu, Gandhi, Kant (4 philosophers)
- **Week 4**: Nietzsche, Arendt, hooks, Baldwin (4 philosophers)

### Phase 3: AI Persona Development (Weeks 5-6)

#### 3.1 Persona Profile Creation
For each new philosopher, create:
```typescript
const aristotle: PersonaProfile = {
  id: "aristotle",
  name: "Aristotle",
  title: "Practical Philosopher",
  tradition: "aristotelian",
  voice: "Analytical yet approachable, emphasizing balance and practical wisdom",
  focus: "Guide users toward eudaimonia through balanced virtue development",
  virtues: ["practical_wisdom", "temperance", "justice", "courage"],
  signaturePractices: ["virtue assessment", "golden mean reflection", "habit tracking"],
  conversationStyle: "Systematic analysis followed by concrete applications",
  knowledgeTags: ["aristotle", "ethics", "golden_mean", "eudaimonia"],
  // ... additional configuration
}
```

#### 3.2 Persona Testing
- Test conversation flows with sample user queries
- Validate philosophical accuracy
- Ensure distinct voice from existing personas
- Measure user engagement and helpfulness

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 7-8)

#### 4.1 Ingestion Pipeline Execution
- Run ingestion script for all new content
- Validate embedding quality and retrieval accuracy
- Test RAG performance with various query types

#### 4.2 End-to-End Testing
- Test conversations with each new persona
- Validate content retrieval relevance
- Measure response quality and philosophical accuracy
- Load testing with concurrent users

#### 4.3 Quality Assurance
- Cross-reference philosophical content accuracy
- Test edge cases (ambiguous queries, multiple traditions)
- Validate performance metrics (response time, relevance scores)
