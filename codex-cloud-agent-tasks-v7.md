# Cloud Agent Task Brief - Q4 Workstreams v7

## Context Snapshot
- âœ… **Task 1 (AI Telemetry)**: Complete - Full telemetry pipeline with PostHog events, provider health tracking, and /api/health endpoint with provider statistics.
- âœ… **Task 2 (Provider Abstraction)**: Complete - Robust failover system with Anthropic/Ollama embedding support, health caching, and comprehensive error handling.
- âœ… **Task 3 (Retrieval Pipeline)**: Complete - Hybrid RAG with pgvector similarity, persona-aware prompts, streaming responses with citations, and caching for optimal latency.
- âœ… **Task 4 (PWA & Offline)**: Complete - Workbox service worker, install prompts, offline sync, connectivity indicators, and comprehensive PWA manifest.
- ðŸ”„ **Task 5 (Deployment & Operations)**: In Progress - Docker Compose parity, deployment guides, and observability runbooks.

## Mission
Complete deployment and operations enablement to make Pocket Philosopher production-ready with repeatable deployment processes and comprehensive operational documentation.

### Task 5: Deployment and Operations Enablement
- Goal: Produce repeatable deployment guides, runbooks, and tooling parity.
- References: docs/build-plan/tasks/deployment-and-operations/tasks.md, docs/deployment/local-onboarding.md.
- Actions:
  1. âœ… **Finalize Docker Compose parity** across Next.js, Supabase, and optional Redis/Ollama, updating onboarding docs accordingly.
  2. âœ… **Draft staging and production rollout guides** covering secrets, migrations, backups, and rollback procedures.
  3. âœ… **Author observability runbooks** and release checklists aligned with new telemetry.
- Done When: A new engineer can follow documentation to provision staging, run smoke tests, and promote a release without additional tribal knowledge.

## Recent Progress Summary
