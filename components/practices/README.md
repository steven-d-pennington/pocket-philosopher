# Practices Components

UI for practice creation, editing, cadence planning, and logging. These modules integrate with the practices store and Supabase-powered hooks documented in the build plan. The practice roster page renders Supabase data with filters, archive/restore toggles, and edit modals; the create modal supports virtue selection, active-day cadence toggles, reminder inputs, and tag metadata.
