From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.",

For example, if thou art offended because a man is ungrateful, turn thy thoughts to thyself, and consider whether thou thyself hast not been ungrateful to others. If thou art offended because a man is faithless, consider whether thou thyself hast not been faithless. For by attending to this, thou wilt forget thy anger, and wilt be less prone to it in the future. Remember that to be offended is to be angry with thyself for not having foreseen the fault.",
