Now it is a mean between two vices, that which depends on excess and that which depends on defect; and again it is a mean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceed what is right in both passions and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses that which is intermediate. Hence also it is no easy task to be good. For in everything it is no easy task to find the middle, e.g. to find the middle of a circle is not for everyone but for him who knows; so, too, any one can get angry—that is easy—or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for everyone, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness is both rare and laudable and noble.",

Will not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life? Shall we not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon what is right? And if so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine what it is, and of which of the sciences or capacities it is the object. It would seem to belong to the most authoritative art and that which is most truly the master art. And politics appears to be of this nature; for it is this that ordains which of the sciences should be studied in a state, and which each class of citizens should learn and up to what point; indeed, we see even the most highly esteemed of capacities to fall under this, e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric; now, since politics uses the rest of the sciences, and since, again, it legislates as to what we are to do and what we are to abstain from, the end of this science must include those of the others, so that this end must be the good for man.",

But the man who is good at deliberating in general is the one who is capable of aiming in accordance with calculation at the best for man of things attainable by action. Nor is practical wisdom concerned with universals only—it must also recognize the particulars; for it is concerned with action and action is concerned with particulars. Hence some who do not know, and especially those who have experience, are more practical than others who know. For if a man knew that light meats are digestible and wholesome, but did not know which sorts of meat are light, he would not produce health; but the man who knows that chicken is wholesome is more likely to produce health.",

Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which puppet players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets. And do you see men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? To them, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images. And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck around and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows.",

The many beautiful things and the rest which we previously described as many, we now describe conversely in accordance with a single Form, assuming it to be a single entity, and we call each of them 'what really is.' We say that the many beautiful things are the objects of sight but not of intelligence, while the Forms are the objects of intelligence but not of sight. Then what is that which sees? The eye, I suppose. And does not that which hears hear by means of the ear? By all means. But the eye cannot see itself; and similarly, that which knows has a knowable Form of knowledge. But the Good itself is not sight, nor is it knowledge, but it is the cause of both—something still more honorable than these.",

The greatest and fairest sort of wisdom is that which is concerned with the ordering of cities and households, and that is called moderation and justice.

It was possible for the soul, when it perceived things either through sight or hearing or some other sense, to be reminded by these of other things which it had forgotten, things which were associated with them and which they resembled, whether like or unlike.

He cannot search for what he knows—since he knows it, there is no need to search—nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for. The soul, then, being immortal and having been born many times, and having seen all things both here and in the other world, has learned everything that is. So we need not be surprised if it can recall the knowledge of virtue or anything else which it once possessed.
