All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him.",

Therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature. Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul.",

No. But if a man breaks, we say, 'Alas, what has happened?' Learn then not to be surprised at the breakage of a vessel, nor at the death of a man. For as the vessel is broken, so must a man die. And what is more, the wife of a potter or the child of a baker must also die.",

In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don't try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.",

They were careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream. Alert as a warrior in enemy territory. Courteous as a guest. Fluid as melting ice. Shapeable as a block of wood. Receptive as a valley. Clear as a glass of water. Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself?",

Bad faith then has in appearance the structure of falsehood. Only what changes is the intention. In the case of bad faith, the intention is to flee from oneself, to flee from what one is in order to establish oneself as what one is not. But this flight from oneself is not a flight toward something else; it is a flight from oneself toward oneself.",

Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism. And this is what people call its 'subjectivity,' using the word as a reproach against us. But what do we mean to say by this, but that man is of a greater dignity than a stone or a table? For we mean to say that man primarily exists - that man is, before he is anything else, something which propels itself towards a future and is aware that it is doing so.",
